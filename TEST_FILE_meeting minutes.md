**Project Alpha: Q3 Marketing Strategy Review**

Date: September 9, 2025  
Attendees: Sarah (CEO), Mark (Marketing Lead), Leo (Finance Lead), Jennifer (Product Manager)  
**Summary:** The team met to finalize the marketing strategy for the new product launch.

**Discussion:**

**Sarah (CEO):** "Okay team, thanks for joining. I've been thinking about this a lot, and I really believe the way forward is a massive digital advertising push. Let's aim for a budget of exactly **$500,000**. That seems like a strong anchor point for us to build on."

**Mark (Marketing Lead):** "I've been looking at the data from our last campaign. While social media performed well, the conversion rate was lower than expected. I'm a bit concerned about the scale of this, but if you're confident, Sarah, then I'm on board. We can make it work."

**Leo (Finance Lead):** "I remember the debacle with the 'Project Nova' launch. We poured a ton of money into a similar campaign back then, and it flopped. It was a disaster. I think we need to be extremely cautious and probably avoid a large-scale launch altogether to prevent a repeat of that."

**Jennifer (Product Manager):** "I agree with Mark. This feels right. Everyone seems to be on the same page, and a unified approach is what we need to get this done fast."

**Mark (Marketing Lead):** "Yeah, it just feels like the right thing to do. All the successful startups we've seen recently have done this exact thing, so it's a proven strategy."

**Leo (Finance Lead):** "I'm concerned about the framing. You're saying we'll have a 90% chance of success, but that also means a 10% chance of losing everything. My analysis shows a much higher risk profile than we're admitting."

**Sarah (CEO):** "Thatâ€™s a fair point, Leo, but look at it this way: we've got a fantastic team here, and we knew from the beginning that the last project was a bad idea. This time it's different. We can't let a past mistake hold us back from a huge opportunity."
